## Next JS Part 1

> Welcome to my blog on app development with Next.js! In this post, I will provide a brief introduction to Next.js and discuss how to set up your computer for Next.js app development. I will also provide a simple "Hello, World!" example using JavaScript, which is commonly used in Next.js app development.

> Next.js is an open-source web application framework created for building server-rendered React applications. It allows developers to create fast and scalable web applications with ease. Next.js leverages the power of React for building user interfaces and provides server-side rendering and routing capabilities.

To start developing Next.js apps, you will need to set up your computer with the Next.js framework and any necessary dependencies. The first step is to install Next.js, which you can do by following the instructions on the Next.js website: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started

Once you have installed Next.js, you can set up your preferred code editor. Next.js is compatible with various editors, including Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and JetBrains WebStorm, which offer features like code completion, debugging tools, and hot module replacement.

To create a simple "Hello, World!" app in Next.js, you can use JavaScript to display a message on a web page. Here's an example:

---

### Hello World code

```javascript
function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

To run this code, you can use the Next.js development server by running `npm run dev` in a terminal window. This will start the server and allow you to access the app in your web browser.

In addition to creating simple components like the one above, Next.js offers powerful features for server-side rendering, routing, and data fetching, making it an excellent choice for building modern web applications.

In our next lesson, we'll delve deeper into Next.js, exploring its capabilities, routing, and advanced features. Stay tuned!
